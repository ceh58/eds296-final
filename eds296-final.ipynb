    "Indonesia has a tropical climate, experiencing two seasons: wet (November-April) and dry (May-October).  It is a key part of the Coral Triangle, a region with at least 500 species of important reef-building corals. Corals are highly sensitive to changes in water temperature, and will bleach (expel their zooxanthellae) after prolonged exposure to warmer temperatrues (or changes of greater than 1°C). I would expect climate change to drive ocean temperatures up, leading to widespread bleaching and mass coral loss. Coral loss has many implications for the oceans and the people that depend on them, such as loss in food source, coastal protection, and tourism. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indonesia's first mass bleacing event was recorded in [1997-1998](https://indonesia.wcs.org/Initiatives/Marine/Coral-Bleaching.aspx). Since then, there have also been bleaching events in [2016-2017 and 2021](https://theseapeople.org/2024/12/18/coral-bleaching-raja-ampat/). Thus, I am interested in looking at historical (1900-1930) and late century (1995-2025) average sea surface temperatures. I chose the late 20th century time period to cover the span of the mass bleaching events to see if there was a significant change (increase) in ocean temperature as compared to the historical temperature. \n",

It represents a high-emissions pathway, with CO² emissions projected to double by 2100. This can lead to significant challenges in both mitigation and adaptation.\n",

    "The SSP5-8.5 scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5 with a radiative forcing of 8.5 W/m² by 2100) is the highest-emissions pathway in the CMIP6 framework and represents a fossil-fueled development future. It predicts very high GHG emissions, with CO2 emissions tripling by 2075. This scenario provides insight into the upper range of climate system response to greenhouse gas forcing, useful for stress-testing infrastructure, understanding tipping points, and preparing for high-impact outcomes.\n"
