    "Indonesia has a tropical climate, experiencing two seasons: wet (November-April) and dry (May-October).  It is a key part of the Coral Triangle, a region with at least 500 species of important reef-building corals. Corals are highly sensitive to changes in water temperature, and will bleach (expel their zooxanthellae) after prolonged exposure to warmer temperatrues (or changes of greater than 1°C). I would expect climate change to drive ocean temperatures up, leading to widespread bleaching and mass coral loss. Coral loss has many implications for the oceans and the people that depend on them, such as loss in food source, coastal protection, and tourism. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indonesia's first mass bleacing event was recorded in [1997-1998](https://indonesia.wcs.org/Initiatives/Marine/Coral-Bleaching.aspx). Since then, there have also been bleaching events in [2016-2017 and 2021](https://theseapeople.org/2024/12/18/coral-bleaching-raja-ampat/). Thus, I am interested in looking at historical (1900-1930) and late century (1995-2025) average sea surface temperatures. I chose the late 20th century time period to cover the span of the mass bleaching events to see if there was a significant change (increase) in ocean temperature as compared to the historical temperature. \n",
